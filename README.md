# Gensokyo Pixel Dungeon

This is heavily inspired by Shattered PD (obviously), (old) TouhouPD and Tommorow's RougeNights. The game also borrow idea from some other forks (usually from TrashBox stuffs though). So check out TouhouPD, Summoning PD, RKPD2-DLC (now RK-Adventure), Too Cruel PD, RougeNights, etc so make sure to check them out!

Progress:
- 4 new characters, they are a based on the classic existing 4. Plus Sakuya who is broken, she's there because it's harder to remove her, you can pick her to handicap yoruself since half her kit doesn't work.
- All new character have their own unique subclasses, no armor ability
- A few more weapon to spice up the gameplay, spread evenly between tiers. They have lower drop rate though. Might nerf later, or change them into secret weapons. High Priority
- New challenges: Lunatic where all enemy have additional perk and skill, doesn't affect normal boss though.
- Alternative path (Up to 20 floors, last 5 still Demon Hall): Gensokyo challenge. New enemies, new bosses. Not play tested, but on paper it should be harder in general but easier if you don't get gang up on. Read monster's description, dodge their skill and you should be fine. Except lots of repositioning though, and don't too rely on narrow pathway.

Plan:
- A lot more weapons
- A few artifact (recycle useless gear into alchemy, bomb maker, recycle scroll into guarantee PoFlame or something lol)
- Quite a bunch of secret gear and drop, some may require rare drop, some may require to do something unthinkable.
- Maybe set effect
- NPCs and Description that hint the above things
- No new armor, I'm considering it but not sure what to implement.
- Rouge-like shop: On planning, very low priority
- Badges/UI/About/Changelogs: A few idea, like play whole game without using melee attack or wand lol)
- Consumeable: Some idea, but low priority.
