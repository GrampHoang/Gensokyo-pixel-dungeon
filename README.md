# Gensokyo Pixel Dungeon

A fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon, a fun project I do in the summer. It help me a lot with re-learning and seeing how OOP work, also see why some people hate Java because my god this language is sooo verbose.
This is heavily inspired by Shattered PD (obviously) and (old) TouhouPD. The game also borrow idea from some other forks (usually from TrashBox stuffs though). So check out TouhouPD, Summoning PD, RKPD2-DLC (now RK-Adventure), Too Cruel PD, etc so make sure to check them out!

Also English is not my first language. I have no trouble reading or understanding it, just make writing mistakes every now and then

Progress:
- 4 new characters, they are a based on the classic existing 4. Plus one who is broken (literally) and I don't know how to hide her from selection screen. There will be 1-2 more in the far future.
- All new character have their own unique subclasses, no armor ability
- A few more weapon to spice up the gameplay, spread evenly between tiers. They have lower drop rate though
- No new armor, I'm considering it but not sure what to implement.
- Rouge-like shop (10%?): I'm technically done implementing, but I don't really understand how to make a decent UI for it, I literally hardcoded everything lmao. Also there are a few other problem, but ideas are all here, these are (probably) needed for the alternative path
- Alternative path (20%): It's a challenge that have different enemies AND bosses, my plan is to make it slightly harder yet not too cancerous so that you should rely on the rougelike shop to have slightly better start.
- Badges/UI/About/Changelogs: I haven't touch those lol
- Consumeable: No idea for the moment

If there is any issue, just post them in the github Issue, or ping me on Discord.
