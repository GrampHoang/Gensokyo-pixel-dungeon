# Gensokyo Pixel Dungeon

This is heavily inspired by Shattered PD (obviously), (old) TouhouPD and Tommorow's RougeNights. The game also borrow idea from some other forks (usually from TrashBox stuffs though). So check out TouhouPD, Summoning PD, RKPD2-DLC (now RK-Adventure), Too Cruel PD, RougeNights, etc.

Progress:
- 4 new characters, they are a based on the classic existing 4. Plus Sakuya who is broken, she's there because it's harder to remove her, you can pick her to handicap yoruself since half her kit doesn't work.
- All new character have their own unique subclasses, no armor ability
- A few more weapon to spice up the gameplay, spread evenly between tiers. They have lower drop rate though. Might nerf later, or change them into secret weapons. High Priority
- New challenges: Lunatic where all enemy have additional perk and skill, doesn't affect normal boss though. It require constant kiting and re-positioning so becareful.
- Alternative path (Currently up to 20 floors, last 5 are still Demon Hall): Gensokyo challenge. New enemies, new bosses. Not play tested, but on paper it should be harder in general but easier if you don't get gang up on. Read monster's description, dodge their skill and you should be fine. Except lots of repositioning though, and don't too rely on narrow pathway. I expect the first boss to be good enough, 2nd might be too hard (on Lunatic), third is.. kinda lame and 4th one is a bit overwhelming.
- Ascension Run: Nothing, Gensokyo monster doesn't get buff by ascension, but killing them doesn't seem to reduce the curse down so it is still a challenge, albeit a bit different.

Plan:
- A lot more weapons, I'm thinking about SP/skill weapon like RougeNight, stay tune!
- A few artifact (recycle useless gear into alchemy, bomb maker, recycle scroll into guarantee PoFlame or something lol). Some might have hidden upgrade
- Quite a bunch of secret gear and drop, some may require rare drop, some may require to do something unthinkable.
- Maybe set effect, just maybe, to encourage keeping rings and artifact instead of just throw them away.
- NPCs and Description that hint the above things
- No new armor, I'm considering it but not sure what to implement.
- Rouge-like shop: On planning, very low priority
- Collectible: seperated bag slot for these kind of items, they will be used to slightly buff stats, special effect for special occasion, consumable and hidden recipe. Though I need to somehow make the game scale harder to counter this power up, or make secret boss/hard side quest to get them, mhm... very low priority
- Badges/UI/About/Changelogs: A few idea, low priority
- Consumeable: Some idea, but low priority.
