# Gensokyo Pixel Dungeon

A fork of Shattered Pixel Dungeon, a fun project I do in the summer. It help me a lot with re-learning and seeing how OOP work, also see why some people hate Java because my god this language is sooo verbose.
This is heavily inspired by Shattered PD (obviously) and TouhouPD. The game also borrow idea from some other forks (usually from TrashBox stuffs though). So check out TouhouPD, Summoning PD, RKPD2-DLC (now RK-Adventure), Too Cruel PD, etc so make sure to check them out!

Also English is not my first language. I have no trouble reading or understanding it, just make writing mistakes every now and then

Current progress:
+ 4 playable characters: Reimu, Marisa, Koishi and Reisen. They all very loosely based on existing 4 characters, but I can guarantee you that they feels different enough. Sakuya will probably be scrapped, I have idea for 1 more character that can fundamentally change dungeon, mobs' atrributes and other game mechanics but that will take a while and I haven't even started yet.
+ Some news weapons for those characters, they all have their own quirk that, hopefully, is viable enough to dump all SoU into those for an alternative fun gameplay.
+ A hat for koishi 
+ Mostly unique talents (and talent arts that I draw). Using just paint and mouse so I hope it doesn't look too weird.
+ No new quests, mobs, bosses, shops. I do want to intergrate Gensokyo section into post-Yog, as well as unlock permanent small upgrade like an actual Rougelike. Basically somewhat Sprouted-like  approach but in different end-game goals and preperations.
+ Haven't really try to balance the game yet, since I can casually clear SPD 6 challenges runs so my bias can't really apply to normal players. Though I expect they will perform better than the other 4 classes:
	- Reimu is really offensive and will have some defendisve problem. Maybe need more defensive penalty.
	- Marisa is Ultra offensive but will need good SoU managements to really "shine". Magician is stupid, as stupid as Warlock, but fun. Marisa will appreciate if you get her lots of wands. Or you can also go melee Marisa for some self handicap meme if you are bored with 9 challenges.
	- Koishi is weird and allow for a completely differerent gameplay (I hope you can figure out what I am thinking about), I will have to penaly her hunger and exp gain a bit more. You can also go for the Doom + Fury route for an alternative gameplay.
	- Reisen proc chance is probably too high and proc too many debuffs, but she will struggle when fighting with multiple enemies, may need a way to force careful pathing without being too sctrict. Dump all SoU into her hands for some push a shoot gameplay.
	- Sakuya is actually 70% complete, most Talents related to Hourglass's timefreeze won't work but the rest work just fine. She's really straight forward aaand I haven't test her to see if there is any bug at all.
+ No armor ability, I have ideas for them already but that's more stuff to balance lol. Current use 3 tele-jumping armor ability as filler, feels free to use those or skip those if you want.

If there is any issue, just post them in the github Issue, or ping me on Discord.
