# Gensokyo Pixel Dungeon

This is forked from Shattered PD v1.3.1. Inspired by (old) TouhouPD and Tomorrow's RougeNights. The game also borrow idea from some other forks.

# Progress 


(Base on the source code, not the released files so some of this may not be in the apk/jar you downloaded):
- 4 new characters, their playstyle loosely based on the 4 original classes. Plus Sakuya who is a broken character. You can pick her to handicap yourself since half her kit doesn't work.

- All new character have their own unique subclasses, no unique armor ability as of now.
- A bunch more weapon to spice up the gameplay. Including secret weapons!

- New Weapon SP mechanic: some weapons have special skill(s). You can gain "skill points" to use them by just hitting the enemies

- New challenge "Lunatic": all enemy have additional perk/skill. This make the game more dynamic, force you to run around a bit more!
- Alternative path (Currently up to 20 floors) - the "Gensokyo" challenge: New enemies, new bosses. My aim is it to be harder in general but easier if you don't get gang up on. Read monster's description, dodge their skill! Except lots of repositioning, don't too rely on narrow pathway!

# Plan:
- Finish and flesh out the first 4 regions. 3rd boss is unfinished and there are lots of unintended behavior (due to bad coding)
- Draw more! Currently I borrow a lot from TouhouPD for the aesthetic.
- More weapons!
- Introducing "Encounters", if you meet some NPC and meet their requirement, they may unlock something new permanently. For replayability purpose.
- A few more spells/items that can synergy with weapon skill and help adapt with new challenges.
- Finishing the NPCs
- Music (will compressed) and SFX
- Making unique armor ability
- Badges: For the new stuff

# My goal:
- Is to make SPD but with different approach, more option and playstyle to go for and have more replayability.
- 
If there is any issue, you can use the feedback link inside the game or find me on Pixel Dungeon Discord.
