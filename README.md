# Shattered Touhou Pixel Dungeon

TouhouPD with ShatteredPD balancing, I just do it for fun lol, no apk or jar anytime soon, you gotta download and run debug with gradle, follow SPD coding guide for that.
I know TouhouPD exist, I loved it, but it's a bit too much... too bloated and take too long to play so I'mma take a diffrent direction for this one.

Thanks tpd0618 for the sprites, I don't know where you get those (or you draw it your own? OwO) but most if not all assets will be borrow from TouhouPD. Except talents, I drew my own talents image
